# CodeBook

The aim of this file is to explain the different variables included in the script run_analysis.R

# Source of the data 

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

# Variables description
A description of all the variables is included in the file features_info.txt located in https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
We have included a subset of these variables. Concretely, we have chosen just the variables relative to the mean and the standard deviation. We have also changed their names so that they are more easily readable and understandable in order to make them as descriptive as possible.

# Steps to follow 

1. Unzip the data into your working directory
2. Download run_analysis.R and save it into your working directory
3. Once the script is run in your computer, it creates a file in your working directory called TidyData.txt with the tidy data set created from the data in the zip folder
4. The script automatically downloads the plyr package which is needed
